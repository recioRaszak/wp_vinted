WP Vinted is a WordPress Plugin for displaying your Vinted uploads inside a page, using a shortcode.

Requirements are, a vinted account, of course, your user ID (number, easy to get from your profile url or link URL to your profile), and a set of public API Credentials (URL, Key and Secret).

API Credentials are also easy to get from rapidapi.com, take a look, It's great!
